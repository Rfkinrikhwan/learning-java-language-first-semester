---

### **Module 5: If Statements**  
Use conditional statements to make decisions in Java programs.  
- **Topics**: `if`, `if-else`, and nested `if` statements.  

---

### **Module 6: Switch Statements**  
Simplify decision-making using **switch-case** statements.  
- **Topics**: Switch-case logic for efficient program control.  

---

### **Module 7: Loops with While**  
Learn to execute code repeatedly using **while loops**.  
- **Topics**: Loop initialization, condition, and iteration.  

---

### **Module 8: Loops with Do-While**  
Explore how **do-while** ensures code execution at least once.  
- **Topics**: Differences between `while` and `do-while` loops.  

---

### **Module 9: Loops with For**  
Use **for loops** for repeated tasks with clear control.  
- **Topics**: Loop counters, conditions, and nested loops.  

---

### **Module 10: Strings in Java**  
Work with **strings** and learn string manipulation techniques.  
- **Topics**: String methods, concatenation, and operations.  

---

### **Module 11: Methods Without Parameters**  
Create reusable methods that do not take input parameters.  
- **Topics**: Method creation and code reusability.  

---

### **Module 12: Methods with Parameters**  
Implement methods that accept input through parameters.  
- **Topics**: Passing arguments and returning values.  

---

### **Module 13: Arrays - Single Dimensional**  
Learn to work with **single-dimensional arrays** in Java.  
- **Topics**: Array declaration, initialization, and traversal.  

---

### **Module 14: Arrays - Multi-Dimensional**  
Advance to **multi-dimensional arrays** for more complex data storage.  
- **Topics**: 2D arrays and matrix operations.  

---

### **Module 15: Classes and Objects I**  
Dive into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts with classes and objects.  
- **Topics**: Defining classes, creating objects, and using methods.  

---

### **Module 16: Classes and Objects II**  
Deepen your understanding of **OOP** with advanced concepts.  
- **Topics**: Constructors, method overloading, and encapsulation.  

---

## Learning Goals  
1. Build a strong understanding of **Java programming concepts**.  
2. Gain proficiency in control structures, loops, and conditionals.  
3. Master **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.  
4. Develop problem-solving skills through practical programming exercises.  

---

## How to Use This Repository  
Each module represents a topic with examples and exercises in **Java**.  
1. Explore each module sequentially.  
2. Review the source files and code examples.  
3. Run the programs and modify the code to practice and experiment.
